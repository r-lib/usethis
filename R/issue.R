#' Helpers for GitHub issues
#'
#' @description
#' The `issue_*` family of functions allows you to perform common operations on
#' GitHub issues from within R. They're designed to help you efficiently deal
#' with large numbers of issues, particularly motivated by the challenges faced
#' by the tidyverse team.
#'
#' * `issue_close_community()` closes an issue, because it's not a bug report or
#'   feature request, and points the author towards RStudio Community as a
#'   better place to discuss usage (<https://community.rstudio.com>).
#'
#' * `issue_reprex_needed()` labels the issue with the "reprex" label and
#'   gives the author some advice about what is needed.
#'
#' @section Saved replies:
#'
#' Unlike GitHub's "saved replies", these functions can:
#' * Be shared between people
#' * Perform other actions, like labelling, or closing
#' * Have additional arguments
#' * Include randomness (like friendly gifs)
#'
#' @param number Issue number
#' @param reprex Does the issue also need a reprex?
