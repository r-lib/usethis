#' Add a code of conduct
#'
#' Adds a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file to the active project and lists in
#' `.Rbuildignore`, in the case of a package. The goal of a code of conduct is
#' to foster an environment of inclusiveness, and to explicitly discourage
#' inappropriate behaviour. The template comes from
#' <http://contributor-covenant.org>, version 1:
#' <http://contributor-covenant.org/version/1/0/0/>.
#'
#' @param path Path of the directory to put `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in, relative to
#'   the active project. Passed along to [use_directory()]. Default is to locate
#'   at top-level, but `.github/` is also common.
