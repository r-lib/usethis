#' Add a code of conduct
#'
#' Adds a `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` file to the active project and lists in
#' `.Rbuildignore`, in the case of a package. The goal of a code of conduct is
#' to foster an environment of inclusiveness, and to explicitly discourage
#' inappropriate behaviour. The template comes from
#' <https://contributor-covenant.org>, version 2:
#' <https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0>.
#'
#' If your package is going to CRAN, the link to the CoC in your README must
#' be an absolute link to a rendered website as `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` is not
#' included in the package sent to CRAN. `use_code_of_conduct()` will
#' automatically generate this link if (1) you use pkgdown and (2) have set the
#' `url` field in `_pkgdown.yml`; otherwise it'll link to
#' <https://contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0>.
#'
#' @param path Path of the directory to put `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` in, relative to
#'   the active project. Passed along to [use_directory()]. Default is to locate
#'   at top-level, but `.github/` is also common.
