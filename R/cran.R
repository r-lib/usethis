#' CRAN submission comments
#'
#' Creates `cran-comments.md`, a template for your communications with CRAN when
#' submitting a package. The goal is to clearly communicate the steps you have
#' taken to check your package on a wide range of operating systems. If you are
#' submitting an update to a package that is used by other packages, you also
#' need to summarize the results of your [reverse dependency
#' checks][use_revdep].
