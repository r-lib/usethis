# Legacy author fields are challenged

    Code
      challenge_legacy_author_fields()
    Message
      x Found legacy Author and/or Maintainer field in DESCRIPTION.
        usethis only supports modification of the Authors@R field.
      i We recommend one of these paths forward:
        * Delete these fields and rebuild with `use_author()`.
        * Convert to Authors@R with `desc::desc_coerce_authors_at_r()`,
          then delete the legacy fields.

      Query: Do you want to cancel this operation and sort that out first?

# Decline to tweak an existing author

    Code
      use_author("Jennifer", "Bryan", role = "cph")
    Condition
      Error in `check_author_is_novel()`:
      ! "Jennifer Bryan" already appears in "Authors@R".
      Please make the desired change directly in DESCRIPTION or call the desc package directly.
