Various ways to zip the foo folder found here.

```{bash}
tree foo
```

## Not Loose Parts or "GitHub style"

This is the structure of ZIP files yielded by GitHub via links of the forms <https://github.com/r-lib/usethis/archive/master.zip> and <http://github.com/r-lib/usethis/zipball/master/>.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
zip -r foo-not-loose.zip foo/
```

```{r}
foo_not_loose_files <- unzip("foo-not-loose.zip", list = TRUE)
with(
  foo_not_loose_files,
  data.frame(Name = Name, dirname = dirname(Name), basename = basename(Name))
)
```

## Loose Parts, the Regular Way

This is the structure of many ZIP files I've seen, just in general.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd foo
zip ../foo-loose-regular.zip *
cd ..
```

```{r}
foo_loose_regular_files <- unzip("foo-loose-regular.zip", list = TRUE)
with(
  foo_loose_regular_files,
  data.frame(Name = Name, dirname = dirname(Name), basename = basename(Name))
)
```

## Loose Parts, the DropBox Way

This is the structure of ZIP files yielded by DropBox via links of this form <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/12345abcde/6789wxyz?dl=1>. I can't figure out how to even do this with zip locally, so I had to create an example on DropBox and download it. Jim Hester reports it is possible with `archive::archive_write_files()`.

<https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5qfvssimxf2ja58/AABz3zrpf-iPYgvQCgyjCVdKa?dl=1>

```{r}
# curl::curl_download(
#   "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/5qfvssimxf2ja58/AABz3zrpf-iPYgvQCgyjCVdKa?dl=1",
#    destfile = "foo-loose-dropbox.zip"
# )
foo_loose_dropbox_files <- unzip("foo-loose-dropbox.zip", list = TRUE)
with(
  foo_loose_dropbox_files,
  data.frame(Name = Name, dirname = dirname(Name), basename = basename(Name))
)
```

Also note that, when unzipping with `unzip` you get this result:

```
Archive:  foo-loose-dropbox.zip
warning:  stripped absolute path spec from /
mapname:  conversion of  failed
  inflating: file.txt
```

So this is a pretty odd ZIP packing strategy. But we need to plan for it.

## Subdirs only at top-level

Let's make sure we detect loose parts (or not) when the top-level has only directories, not files.

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
zip -r yo-not-loose.zip yo/
```

```{r}
(yo_not_loose_files <- unzip("yo-not-loose.zip", list = TRUE))
top_directory(yo_not_loose_files$Name)
```

```{bash, eval = FALSE}
cd yo
zip -r ../yo-loose-regular.zip *
cd ..
```

```{r}
(yo_loose_regular_files <- unzip("yo-loose-regular.zip", list = TRUE))
top_directory(yo_loose_regular_files$Name)
```

```{r}
# curl::curl_download(
#   "https://www.dropbox.com/sh/afydxe6pkpz8v6m/AADHbMZAaW3IQ8zppH9mjNsga?dl=1",
#    destfile = "yo-loose-dropbox.zip"
# )
(yo_loose_dropbox_files <- unzip("yo-loose-dropbox.zip", list = TRUE))
top_directory(yo_loose_dropbox_files$Name)
```
