usethis is a workflow package: it automates repetitive tasks that arise during project setup and development, both for R packages and non-package projects.

## Installation

Install the released version of usethis from CRAN:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
install.packages("usethis")
```

Or install the development version from GitHub with:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("r-lib/usethis")
```

## Usage

Most `use_*()` functions operate on the *active project*: literally, a directory on your computer. If you've just used usethis to create a new package or project, that will be the active project. Otherwise, usethis verifies that current working directory is or is below a valid project directory and that becomes the active project. Use `proj_get()` or `proj_sitrep()` to manually query the project and [read more in the docs](https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/proj_utils.html).

A few usethis functions have no strong connections to projects and will expect you to provide a path.

usethis is quite chatty, explaining what it's doing and assigning you tasks. `✔` indicates something usethis has done for you. `●` indicates that you'll need to do some work yourself.

Below is a quick look at how usethis can help to set up a package. But remember, many usethis functions are also applicable to analytical projects that are not packages.

```{r, include = FALSE}
# Reset possible options
options(usethis.description = list())
```

```{r}
library(usethis)

# Create a new package -------------------------------------------------
path <- file.path(tempdir(), "mypkg")
create_package(path)
# only needed since this session isn't interactive
proj_activate(path)

# Modify the description ----------------------------------------------
use_mit_license("My Name")

use_package("MASS", "Suggests")

# Set up other files -------------------------------------------------
use_readme_md()

use_news_md()

use_test("my-test")

x <- 1
y <- 2
use_data(x, y)

# Use git ------------------------------------------------------------
use_git()
```
