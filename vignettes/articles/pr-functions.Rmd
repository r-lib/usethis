## Contributing to someone else's package

So, you want to contribute to an R package? That's fantastic!

Here we walk through the process of making a so-called **pull request** to the [praise](https://github.com/rladies/praise) package. This package is designed to help package developers "build friendly R packages that praise their users if they have done something good, or they just need it to feel better." You can use praise to construct encouraging feedback by sampling from its collection of positive adjectives, adverbs, verbs, smileys, and exclamations:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(praise)

template <- "${EXCLAMATION} - your pull request is ${adjective}!"

praise(template)
#> [1] "YEE-HAW - your pull request is groovy!"
```

We are going to propose a new adjective: "formidable".

## What's a pull request?

A [pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-requests) is how you propose a change to a GitHub repository. Think of it as a _request_ for the maintainer to _pull_ your changes into their repo.

The `pr_*()` family of functions is designed to make working with GitHub pull requests as painless as possible, for both contributors and package maintainers. They are designed to support the Git and GitHub workflows recommended in [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](http://happygitwithr.com/).

A pull request (PR) involves two players, a contributor and a reviewer. To make it more clear who runs which code, the code chunks in this article are color coded: code executed by the contributor appears in chunks with light gray background and code executed by the reviewer appears in chunks with beige background.

```{r}
#| label: sample_contributor
#| eval: false
# contributor code
```

<div class = "reviewer">
```{r}
#| label: sample_reviewer
#| eval: false
# reviewer code
```

</div>

## Set up advice

This article assumes that you have already done the Git and GitHub parts of the [setup vignette](/articles/articles/usethis-setup) and that you have configured a GitHub personal access token, as described in [Managing Git(Hub) Credentials](/articles/articles/git-credentials.html). A good way to check that you are ready to use the `pr_*` family of functions is to run `git_sitrep()`, which prints info about your current Git, gert, and GitHub setup.

Specifically, the `pr_*()` functions make use of:

  * The GitHub API, which requires a personal access token (PAT).
    - `create_github_token()` helps you set one up.
  * Your preferred Git transport protocol: `"https"` or `"ssh"`.
    - If usethis can't figure this out, it might ask you. You can set the
    `usethis.protocol` option to proactively address this.
  * gert, an R package which does Git operations from R. The gert package,
    in turn, relies on the credentials package to obtain your Git credentials.
    - If you use the `"https"` protocol, your GitHub PAT is the only credential
      you need. Which is a good reason to choose `"https"`!

## Attach usethis

All the code below assumes you've attached usethis in your R session:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(usethis)
```

## Fork and clone

The first step is to fork the source repository, to get your own copy on GitHub, and then clone that, to get your own local copy. There are many ways to accomplish these two steps, but here we demonstrate `usethis::create_from_github()`:

```{r}
#| label: create_from_github
#| eval: false
create_from_github("rladies/praise", destdir = "~/Documents")
```
<div class = "output">
```{r}
#| eval: false
#> ✔ Setting `
fork = TRUE
`.
#> ✔ Creating /Users/rebeccabutler/Documents/praise/.
#> ✔ Forking "rladies/praise".
#> ℹ Waiting for the fork to finalize before cloning...
#> ✔ Cloning repo from "https://github.com/rkb965/praise.git" into /Users/rebeccabutler/Documents/praise.
#> ✔ Setting active project to "/Users/rebeccabutler/Documents/praise".
#> ℹ Default branch is "main".
#> ✔ Adding "upstream" remote: "https://github.com/rladies/praise.git"
#> ✔ Pulling changes from "upstream/main".
#> ✔ Setting remote tracking branch for local "main" branch to "upstream/main".
#> ✔ Opening /Users/rebeccabutler/Documents/praise/ in new RStudio session.
#> ✔ Setting active project to "<no active project>".
```
</div>

What this does:

  * Forks the praise repo, owned by rladies on GitHub, into your GitHub account.
  * Clones your praise repo into a folder named "praise" on your desktop (or
    similar).
    - `origin` remote is set to your praise repo.
  * Does additional Git setup:
    - `upstream` remote is set to the praise repo owned by rladies.
    - `master` branch is set to track `upstream/master`, so you can pull
      upstream changes in the future.
  * Opens a new instance of RStudio in the praise project, if you're working in
    RStudio. Otherwise, switches your current R session to that project.

Arguments you might like to know about:

  * Specify `fork = TRUE` or `fork = FALSE` if you don't want to defer to the
    default behaviour.
  * Use `destdir` to put praise in a specific location on your computer. You can
    set the `usethis.destdir` option if you always want usethis to put new
    projects in a specific directory.

## Branch, then make your change

We start the process of contributing to the package with `pr_init()`, which creates a branch in our repository for the pull request. It is a good idea to make your pull requests from a feature branch, not from the repo's default branch, which is `main` here (formerly, many repos used `master`). We'll call this branch `"exhilarating"`.

```{r}
#| label: pr_init
#| eval: false
pr_init(branch = "exhilarating")
```
<div class = "output">
```{r}
#| eval: false
#> ✔ Setting active project to "/Users/rebeccabutler/Documents/praise".
#> ✔ Pulling changes from "upstream/main".
#> ✔ Creating and switching to local branch "exhilarating".
#> ☐ Use usethis::pr_push() to create a PR.
```
</div>
This creates a local branch called `exhilarating` and we switch to it (or "check it out"). Now you can work locally, making changes to files and committing them to Git.

Let's go ahead and make the change, which is adding the word "exhilarating" to the `R/adjective.R` file in the package. Below is the diff and the commit associated with this change.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: >
#|     Screenshot of the RStudio Git pane showing the file
#|     R/adjective.R staged for a commit. The preview of the file
#|     highlights the addition of the line exhilerating, with no comma
#|     at the end of the line. The Commit message says
#|     Add exhilarating to adjectives.
#| out.width: "90%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-functions-diff-light.png", dpi = 300)
```

You might spot that we made two mistakes here:

1.  We intended to add "exhilarating", but added "exhilerating" instead.
2.  We forgot a comma at the end of the line.

Let's assume we didn't actually catch these mistakes, and didn't build and check
the package, which would have revealed the missing comma. We all make mistakes.

## Submit pull request

`pr_push()` pushes the local change to your copy of praise on GitHub and puts you in position to make your pull request.

```{r}
#| label: pr_push
#| eval: false
pr_push()
```
<div class = "output">
```{r}
#| eval: false
#> ✓ Checking that local branch 'exhilarating' has the changes in 'origin/exhilarating'
#> ✓ Pushing local 'exhilarating' branch to 'origin/exhilarating'
#> ✓ Create PR at link given below
#> ✓ Opening URL 'https://github.com/rkb965/praise/compare/exhilarating'
```
</div>

This launches a browser window at the URL specified in the last message, which
looks like the following.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: >
#|     A screenshot showing the diff on GitHub, with the new version of the
#|     file containing the newly added line exhilerating, with no comma,
#|     highlighted in green. There is a green button that says Create Pull Request.
#| out.width: "90%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-functions-pull-request-light.png", dpi = 300)
```

Click "Create pull request" to make the PR. After clicking you will be able to choose between [draft PR](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) and actual PR (If opening a draft PR, [mark it as ready for review](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/changing-the-stage-of-a-pull-request) once you're done, e.g. after a few more commits and one new call to `pr_push()`).

GitHub will ping the package maintainer and they will review our pull request. We can view this pull request in the browser with `pr_view()`. And anyone can follow along with this PR [rladies/praise#108](https://github.com/rladies/praise/pull/108).

```{r}
#| label: pr_view
#| eval: false
pr_view(108)
```
<div class = "output">
```{r}
#| eval: false
#> ✔ Opening URL <https://github.com/rladies/praise/pull/108>.
```

</div>

## Review of the pull request

If we're lucky and our pull request is ready to merge, the maintainer will accept it, a.k.a. merge it. However, in this case, the PR still needs some work. On the pull request, the package maintainer leaves us comments requesting changes.

> **jennybc** I think this is misspelled? Did you mean "exhilarating"? Also, there is a missing comma.

Being somewhat new to all this, we try to address one of these comments (fix spelling) and neglect the other (forget to add the comma). We make another change and commit it.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: >
#|     A screenshot of the Positron Git pane, showing the changed line
#|     with exhilerating changed to exhilarating. The file R/adjective.R
#|     is staged for a commit, with the commit message Fix Spelling!
#| out.width: "90%"
knitr::include_graphics(
  "img/pr-functions-address-comments-light.png",
  dpi = 300
)
```

Run `pr_push()` again to update the branch in our fork, which is automatically reflected in the PR.

```{r}
#| label: pr_push_again
#| eval: false
pr_push()
```
<div class = "output">
```{r}
#| eval: false
#> ✔ Checking that local branch "exhilarating" has the changes in "origin/exhilarating".
#> ✔ Pushing local "exhilarating" branch to "origin/exhilarating".
#> ☐ View PR at <https://github.com/rladies/praise/pull/108> or call usethis::pr_view().
```
</div>

Note: On the first push of a new branch, usethis points you to GitHub’s “compare” page to create a pull request. On subsequent pushes to an existing PR branch, the message instead points you directly to the pull request (“View PR …”).

Now the reviewer gets another chance to review our changes. In this case, the reviewer chooses to use GitHub's "suggest changes" feature to suggest adding the missing comma. 

As the PR author, we can click "Commit suggestion" to apply the suggestion directly. This creates a new commit in the pull request under our name, without needing to switch to our local machine.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: >
#|     A screenshot of the GitHub pull request under review, showing the
#|     suggestion to add the trailing comma. This suggestion is about
#|     to be committed with the default commit message "Update R/adjective.R"
#|     pre-filled.
#| out.width: "90%"
knitr::include_graphics("img/pr-functions-suggestion-light.png", dpi = 300)
```

This workflow makes it easy for the reviewer to point out small fixes, while still leaving control of the commits with the person who opened the pull request.

In some cases, the reviewer may instead fetch the branch locally with `pr_fetch()`, make changes themselves, and push back to the pull request with `pr_push()`.

## Pull and finish

Since some of the code changes happened on GitHub, we can get that code back to our computer with `pr_pull()`. 

<div class = "output">
```{r}
#| eval: false
#| #> ✔ Pulling from "origin/exhilarating".
```
</div>

Once the reviewer is satisfied with the changes, they finalize the process by merging the pull request on GitHub.

Finally, we can also conclude the PR process on our end with `pr_finish()`.

<div class = "output">
```{r}
#| eval: false
#> ✔ Switching back to default branch ("main").
#> ✔ Pulling changes from "upstream/main".
#> ✔ Deleting local "exhilarating" branch. 
#> ✔ PR rladies/praise/#108 has been merged, deleting remote branch "origin/exhilarating". 
```
</div>

After this, our local copy of the package is up-to-date with the source repo and the branch we used for the PR is deleted.

Remember you can see how this whole PR unfolded at [rladies/praise#108](https://github.com/rladies/praise/pull/108).

## Putting it all together

We walked through one specific pull request from start to finish. To see the big picture, this is a handy flowchart that shows how the various `pr_*()` functions fit together — from starting a new branch, to doing work,  
to sharing changes, and eventually finishing or pausing a PR.  

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-alt: >
#|     Flowchart of the usethis pull request workflow, showing steps
#|     like pr_init(), pr_push(), pr_pull(), pr_finish(), and how
#|     they connect when starting, updating, and completing a PR.

## Other helpful functions

There are a few other functions in the `pr_*()` family that we didn't encounter in this PR scenario:

- `pr_merge_main()` is used for getting changes that have occurred in the main line of development while we have been working on this PR. If you're working in a fork, this does `git pull upstream main`. If you're making a PR from an internal branch, this does `git pull origin main`. This can be useful to execute in your PR branch, if there are big changes in the project and your PR has become un-mergeable. This is also useful to execute whenever you return to the default branch (usually named `main` or `master`) and, indeed, `pr_pause()` includes this. This makes sure that your copy of the package is up-to-date with the source repo.

- `pr_pause()` makes sure you're synced with the PR, switches back to the default branch, and calls `pr_merge_main()` to keep you up-to-date with the source repo. This is likely something a package maintainer reviewing numerous PRs will need to use, as they switch back and forth between reviewing/extending PRs and the main line of development on the default branch.

- `pr_resume()` helps you resume work on a PR after you've spent some time with another branch checked out. If you give it no arguments, it will present an interactive choice of local branches and indicates which, if any, are associated with a PR.
