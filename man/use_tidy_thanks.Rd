\title{Identify contributors via GitHub activity}
\usage{
use_tidy_thanks(repo_spec = NULL, from = NULL, to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{repo_spec}{Optional GitHub repo specification in this form:
\code{owner/repo}. By default, this is inferred from the Git remotes of the
active project. The host is always assumed to be github.com.}

\item{from, to}{GitHub ref (i.e., a SHA, tag, or release) or a timestamp in
ISO 8601 format, specifying the start or end of the interval of interest,
in the sense of \verb{[from, to]}. Examples: "08a560d", "v1.3.0",
"2018-02-24T00:13:45Z", "2018-05-01". When \verb{from = NULL, to = NULL}, we set
\code{from} to the timestamp of the most recent (GitHub) release. Otherwise,
\code{NULL} means "no bound".}
}
\value{
A character vector of GitHub usernames, invisibly.
}
\description{
Derives a list of GitHub usernames, based on who has opened issues or pull
requests. Used to populate the acknowledgment section of package release blog
posts at \url{https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/}. If no arguments are given, we
retrieve all contributors to the active project since it's last (GitHub)
release. Unexported helper functions, \code{releases()} and \code{ref_df()} can be
useful interactively to get a quick look at release tag names and a data
frame about refs (defaulting to releases), respectively.

\dontrun{
## active project, interval = since the last release
use_tidy_thanks()

## active project, interval = since a specific datetime
use_tidy_thanks(from = "2020-07-24T00:13:45Z")

## r-lib/usethis, interval = since a certain date
use_tidy_thanks("r-lib/usethis", from = "2020-08-01")

## r-lib/usethis, up to a specific release
use_tidy_thanks("r-lib/usethis", from = NULL, to = "v1.1.0")

## r-lib/usethis, since a specific commit, up to a specific date
use_tidy_thanks("r-lib/usethis", from = "08a560d", to = "2018-05-14")
