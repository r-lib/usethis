\title{Identify contributors via GitHub activity}
\usage{
use_tidy_thanks(owner = NULL, repo = NULL, from = releases(owner = owner,
  repo = repo)[[1]], to = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{owner}{Name of user or organisation who owns the repo. Default is to
infer from Git remotes of active project.}

\item{repo}{Repository name, usually same as package name. Default is to
infer from Git remotes of active project.}

\item{from, to}{GitHub ref (i.e., a SHA, tag, or release) or a timestamp in
ISO 8601 format, specifying the start or end of the interval of interest.
Examples: "08a560d", "v1.3.0", "2018-02-24T00:13:45Z", "2018-05-01". \code{NULL}
means there is no bound on that end of the interval.}
}
\value{
A character vector of GitHub usernames, invisibly.
}
\description{
Derives a list of GitHub usernames, based on who has opened issues or pull
requests. Used to populate the acknowledgment section of package release blog
posts at \url{https://www.tidyverse.org/articles/}. All arguments can potentially
be determined from the active project, if the project follows standard
practices around the GitHub remote and GitHub releases. Unexported helper
functions, \code{releases()} and \code{ref_df()} can be useful interactively for
a quick look at release tag names and a data frame about refs, respectively.
