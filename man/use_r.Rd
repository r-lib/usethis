\usage{
use_r(name = NULL, open = NULL)

use_test(name = NULL, open = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{name}{Either a name without extension, or \code{NULL} to create the
paired file based on currently open file in the script editor. If
the R file is open, \code{use_test()} will create/open the corresponding
test file; if the test file is open, \code{use_r()} will create/open the
corresponding R file.}

\item{open}{If, \code{NULL}, the default, will open the file when in an
interactive environment that is not running tests. Use \code{TRUE} or
\code{FALSE} to override the default.}
}
\description{
This pair of functions makes it easy to create paired R and test files,
using the convention that the tests for \code{R/foofy.R} should live
in \code{tests/testhat/test-foofy.R}. You can use them to create new files
from scratch by supplying \code{name}, or if you use RStudio, you can call
to create (or navigate to) the paired file based on the currently open
script.
