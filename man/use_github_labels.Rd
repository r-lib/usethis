\usage{
use_github_labels(labels = tidy_labels(), delete_default = FALSE,
  auth_token = NULL, host = NULL)

tidy_labels()
}
\arguments{
\item{labels}{Named character vector of labels. The names are the label text,
such as "bug", and the values are the label colours in hexadecimal, such as
"e02a2a". First, labels that don't yet exist are created, then label
colours are updated.}

\item{delete_default}{If \code{TRUE}, will remove GitHub default labels that do
not appear in the \code{labels} vector (presumably defaults that aren't relevant
to your workflow).}

\item{auth_token}{Provide a personal access token (PAT) from
\url{https://github.com/settings/tokens}. If \code{NULL}, will use the logic
described in \code{\link[gh:gh_whoami]{gh::gh_whoami()}} to look for a token stored in an environment
variable. Use \code{\link[=browse_github_pat]{browse_github_pat()}} to help set up your PAT.}

\item{host}{GitHub API host to use. Override with the endpoint-root for your
GitHub enterprise instance, for example,
"https://github.hostname.com/api/v3"}
}
\description{
\code{use_github_labels()} creates new labels and/or changes label
colours. It does not generally remove labels. But if you set
\code{delete_default = TRUE}, it will delete labels that are (1) flagged by the
API as being \href{https://help.github.com/articles/about-labels/#using-default-labels}{GitHub defaultlabels}
and (2) not present in the labels you provide via \code{labels}.

\code{tidy_labels()} returns the labels and colours commonly used by tidyverse
packages.

\section{Label usage}{

Labels are used as part of the issue-triage process, designed to minimise the
time spent re-reading issues. The absence of a label indicates that an issue
is new, and has yet to be triaged.
\itemize{
\item \code{reprex} indicates that an issue does not have a minimal reproducible
example, and that a reply has been sent requesting one from the user.
\item \code{bug} type, indicates an unexpected problem or unintended behavior.
\item \code{feature} type, indicates a feature request or enhancement.
\item \code{docs} type, indicates an issue with the documentation.
\item \code{performance} indicates a non-breaking area related to performance.
\item \code{wip} indicates that someone else is working on it or has promised to.
\item \code{good first issue} indicates a good issue for first-time contributors.
\item \code{help wanted} indicates that a maintainer wants help on an issue.
