In usethis v2.0.0, usethis switched from git2r to gert (+ credentials) for
all Git operations. This pair of packages (gert + credentials) is designed to
discover and use the same credentials as command line Git. As a result, a
great deal of credential-handling assistance has been removed from usethis,
primarily around SSH keys.

If you have credential problems, focus your troubleshooting on getting the
credentials package to find your credentials. The \href{https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/credentials/vignettes/intro.html}{introductory vignette}
is a good place to start.

If you use the HTTPS protocol, a configured \code{GITHUB_PAT} will satisfy all
auth needs, for both Git and the GitHub API, and is therefore the easiest
approach to get working. See \code{\link[=create_github_token]{create_github_token()}} for more.
