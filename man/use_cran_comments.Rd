\description{
Creates \code{cran-comments.md}, a template for your communications with CRAN when
submitting a package. The goal is to clearly communicate the steps you have
taken to check your package on a wide range of operating systems. If you are
submitting an update to a package that is used by other packages, you also
need to summarize the results of your \link[=use_revdep]{reverse dependency
checks}.
