\description{
This creates a template for your communications with CRAN when submitting a
package. The goal of the file is to clearly communicate what steps you have
taken to check that your package works across a wide range of operating
systems. If you are submitting an update to a package that is used by
other packages, you also need to describe the steps you have taken to
ensure that it does not break existing code on CRAN.
