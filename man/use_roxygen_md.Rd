use_roxygen_md()
}
\description{
You'll need to manually re-document once enabled. If you are already using
roxygen2, but not with markdown, the
\href{https://roxygen2md.r-lib.org}{roxygen2md} package will be used to
convert many Rd expressions to markdown. The package uses heuristics, so
you'll need to check the results.
