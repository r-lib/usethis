\title{Add files to \code{.Rbuildignore}}
\usage{
use_build_ignore(files, escape = TRUE, base_path = ".")
}
\arguments{
\item{files}{Character vector of path names.}

\item{escape}{If \code{TRUE}, the default, will escape \code{.} to
\code{\\.} and surround with \code{^} and \code{$}.}

\item{base_path}{Path to package root.}
}
\description{
\code{.Rbuildignore} has a regular expression on each line, but it's
usually easier to work with specific file names. By default,
\code{use_build_ignore} will (crudely) turn a filename into a regular
expression that will only match that path. Repeated entries will be
silently removed.
