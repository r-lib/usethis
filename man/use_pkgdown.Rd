\href{https://pkgdown.r-lib.org}{pkgdown} makes it easy to turn your package into
a beautiful website. A couple functions help you begin to use pkgdown:
\itemize{
\item \code{use_pkgdown()}: creates a pkgdown config file, adds relevant files or
directories to \code{.Rbuildignore} and \code{.gitignore}, and builds favicons if
your package has a logo.
\item \code{use_github_action("pkgdown")} configures a GitHub Actions workflow to
build and deploy your pkgdown site whenever you push changes to GitHub.
Learn more about \code{\link[=use_github_action]{use_github_action()}}. This approach is actively
maintained, because it is in use across many tidyverse, r-lib, and
tidymodels packages.
\item \code{use_pkgdown_travis()} helps you set up pkgdown for automatic deployment
on Travis-CI. This is something of a legacy function, as the tidyverse
team has shifted away from Travis-CI and towards GitHub Actions. It
creates an empty \code{gh-pages} branch for the site and prompts about next
steps regarding deployment keys and updating your \code{.travis.yml}. Requires
that the current user can push to the primary repo, which must be
configured as the \code{origin} remote.
