# usethis 0.0.0.9000

* `use_description()` now sets `ByteCompile: true` so you can benefit from
  the byte compiler (#29)

* `use_readme_rmd()` now puts images in `man/figures/` and no longer
  adds to `.Rbuildgnore`. This ensures that the rendered `README.md` will
  also work on CRAN (#16, #19). The first chunk now uses `include = FALSE`
  and is named setup (#19).

* `use_github()` now has an organisation parameter so you can create repos
  in organisations (#4).

* Functions are now designed to work with a directory that's not necessarily
  a package. This doesn't always make sense but in the long term makes
  usesthis more flexible for other tasks like (e.g.) data analysis.

* `use_template()` and `use_test()` now convert title to a slug that only
  contains lowercase letters, numbers, and `-`.

* `use_package_doc()` uses more modern roxygen2 template requires even less
  duplication.

* Removed old `add_build_ignore()`

* `use_build_ignore()` now strips trailing `/`
