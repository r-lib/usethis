# Getting help with {{{ Package }}}

Thanks for using {{{ package }}}. Before filing an issue, please take a minute
to look at these materials so that you can get the help you need as quickly as
possible.

The [Get help!](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/) section of the tidyverse site
is a good place to look for general guidance, including how to make a minimal
**repr**oducible **ex**ample (AKA a [reprex](http://reprex.tidyverse.org/)).

Armed with your reprex, your next step is to figure out [where to ask](https://www.tidyverse.org/help/#where-to-ask) your question. We use GitHub 
Issues for bugs, and feature requests.

For questions and help with using {{{ package }}}, 
[community.rstudio.com](https://community.rstudio.com/), and 
[StackOverflow.com](https://stackoverflow.com/) are better places to start. Not 
only are there more people there to answer questions, it's also a good way to 
figure out if your problem _is_ an issue, in which case you can easily return 
here and report it. 

Before opening a new issue, be sure to [search issues and pull requests](https://help.github.com/articles/searching-issues-and-pull-requests/) 
to make sure the bug hasn't been reported and/or already fixed in the 
development version.

If you _are_ in the right place, and need to file an issue, please review the 
["File issues"](https://www.tidyverse.org/contribute/#issues) paragraph from 
the tidyverse contributing guidelines.

Thanks for your help!
