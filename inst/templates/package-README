The goal of {{{ Package }}} is to ...

## Installation

{{#on_github}}
You can install the development version of {{{ Package }}} from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("{{{ github_spec }}}")
```
{{/on_github}}
{{^on_github}}
You can install the development version of {{{ Package }}} like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```
{{/on_github}}

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

{{#needs_render}}
```{r example}
{{/needs_render}}
{{^needs_render}}``` r
{{/needs_render}}
library({{Package}})
## basic example code
```

{{#needs_render}}
What is special about using `README.Rmd` or `README.qmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd`/`README.qmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
